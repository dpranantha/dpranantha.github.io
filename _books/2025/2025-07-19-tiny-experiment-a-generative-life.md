We often hear we should strive to “leave a legacy”, To make something that outlives us, To matter! But what if that’s not the point?

In the final chapter of *Tiny Experiments*, Anne-Laure Le Cunff gently invites us to **shift the lens**:

    Instead of chasing legacy, practice being presently generative.

### Legacy vs. Generativity

Legacy tends to be about the *future*, a trace we hope to leave behind. It’s a noble aspiration, but also one rooted in **control and projection** - in the idea that meaning comes later, when our work is done.

Generativity, in contrast, is about the *now*. It’s a living, breathing form of impact. It’s not about leaving something behind but it’s about **offering something forward**, while we’re still here to feel it.

    Generativity is caring. Creating. Teaching. Sharing.
    It's showing up for others with what we know and what we’ve learned—without needing to be finished or perfect.

And most of all, it’s not about scale, it’s about **depth**.

### Five Practices for a Generative Life

Le Cunff closes the book with a series of empowering strategies to help us live this way - open, creative, and generous in real time.

#### 1. **Do the Work First**

Don’t wait for permission, approval, or the “perfect idea.” Start where you are. Use what you have.

Every side project, sketch, article, post, or conversation is a **proof of work** - evidence of your capacity to create value and connect dots. These are seeds of trust, surface area for serendipity, and acts of personal craftsmanship.

Start. Build. Share. Repeat.

#### 2. **Grow Lateral Roots**

Not all growth goes upward. Some of the most essential expansion is **lateral**. Learn across domains. Try things that don’t “fit” your resume. Talk to people outside your bubble. Lateral roots make us more resilient, creative, and open to unexpected opportunities.

Over time, you’ll build a personal *atlas of skills* - one that lets you spot patterns others miss and make contributions others can’t.

#### 3. **Prioritize Impact Over Image**

Let go of curated appearances. Focus on **what helps, not what looks good**. Success isn't always shiny. Sometimes it's quiet, messy, nonlinear. When we let our curiosity lead and embrace our multi-hyphenate selves, we **free ourselves from narrow definitions** of value.

You don’t have to follow the path. You can make one.

#### 4. **Close the Loop to Open New Doors**

Finish your experiments, even the small ones. Reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Share the learnings, even when things didn’t go as planned.

    People don’t just respect results. They respect integrity, follow-through, and reflection.

Every closed loop builds **credibility** and becomes a stepping stone for others. It’s how trust is built and how we create a culture of generosity in our work.

#### 5. **Play Along the Way**

Generative living isn’t all grind, it’s also **play**.

Play keeps us open. Curious. Light. It gives us room to discover value in places we never expected.

So:

* Start fun projects.
* Follow weird sparks.
* Shut down what no longer brings joy.
* Let yourself *tinker*.

Often, what begins in play becomes something real and deeply impactful.

### The Real Question

Instead of asking:

    What will I leave behind?

Ask:

    How can I use my skills and experiences to help someone today?

That’s the real experiment.

#### We Are an Evolving Canvas

In the end, *Tiny Experiments* teaches us something profoundly freeing:

- We don’t have to know where we’re going.
- We don’t need a master plan.
- We just need to stay open, stay curious, and keep iterating.

    A generative life is one that trusts the journey.
    That believes in the compound magic of small actions.
    That chooses connection over control.
    That leaves ripples - not monuments.

### Wrapping It Up: Tiny Experiments, Big Life

This book, and this journey, has been a testament to how **small, intentional actions** can reshape our relationship with productivity, creativity, community, and self.

From **PACTs** to **ACTs**, from how we **REACT** to how we leave an **IMPACT**, *Tiny Experiments* gives us not a prescription, but a practice:

* To show up mindfully
* To try new things with curiosity
* To reflect and adapt
* To grow - both inward and outward
* And to live generously, in public, and in progress

Thank you for following along as I explored this wonderful book. I hope it inspired you as much as it transformed me.

Now it’s your turn.
- Pick a tiny experiment.
- Start small.
- Share what you learn.
- And see where it leads.

Because in the end, your life doesn’t need to leave a legacy. **It just needs to keep giving - right now.**
