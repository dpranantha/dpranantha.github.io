In Part 1, we explored PACT—the decision to try something small and intentional, not to chase a goal but to better understand ourselves. In Part 2 of Anne-Laure Le Cunff’s Tiny Experiments, we move into the space of ACT. But don’t let the word fool you—this isn’t about doing more, faster. It’s about acting with mindfulness and aligning with our natural rhythms.

### Mindful Productivity: A Kinder Way to Get Things Done
The modern productivity mindset often runs on Chronos time—tight schedules, checklists, and constant striving. But Le Cunff offers a different approach: mindful productivity.

Let’s look at the difference:

| Mindful | Productivity | 	Productivity Mania | 
| --------| -------------| --------------------| 
| Rest, reflection, meaningful flow	|  Cramming everything into a schedule |
| Self-expression | 	Meeting external expectations | 
| Energy-based decision making | 	Rigid time management | 
| Gentle, bottom-up planning | 	Top-down pressure | 

Mindful productivity asks: What supports my attention, my body, and my emotions? Not How can I squeeze more into today?

### Two Kinds of Time: Kairos vs. Chronos
At the heart of ACT is a shift in how we think about time.

- Chronos: Measured, scheduled, quantifiable. Every hour is the same.

- Kairos: Felt, fluid, qualitative. Each moment is unique.

In short, Chronos is clock time. Kairos is soul time.

Le Cunff doesn’t argue that we should reject Chronos—after all, we live in a world that runs on it. But she encourages us to design Kairos rituals within Chronos constraints—to find flow, presence, and clarity amidst the busy noise.

### The Three Magic Windows
To act with intention, we need to understand our inner landscape. Le Cunff encourages us to observe three key aspects of our experience: physical, cognitive, and emotional windows.

1. Physical

Everyone has a magic window—a time of day when energy and clarity peak. Are you a morning person? Do you come alive at night?
These rhythms shift with seasons, age, and hormones.

- High energy → do your most important work

- Low energy → rest or take on light tasks

- Respect your body, don’t push past it

2. Cognitive
Our brain’s executive function is limited.

- Multitasking drains focus

- Working memory can only juggle so much

- Prioritize sequential focus, not over-packed time blocks

- Use your brain’s natural ebb and flow as a guide. Pay attention to when thinking feels fluid, and when it starts to strain.

3. Emotional
Our emotional state directly affects how we work.

- A little stress (eustress) sharpens performance

- Chronic stress dulls clarity and builds into overwhelm

- Emotional agility helps us notice and adjust

Small physical acts—walking, stretching, or breathing deeply—can help us reset and regain presence.

### Designing Kairos Rituals
So how do we bring all this together?

We can design small rituals to open and extend our Kairos windows—gentle acts that interrupt autopilot and bring us back into our bodies.

Here are a few examples:

- A walk before starting work

- Making coffee mindfully

- Listening to a favorite song

- Stretching between tasks

- Journaling or breathing deeply for one minute

These aren’t luxuries—they’re tools for recalibration. Each act helps us tune our physical, cognitive, and emotional state so we can show up more fully.

### Final Thoughts
ACT is about creating the conditions for meaningful action—not by pushing harder, but by aligning more gently with our inner cycles.

- It’s not about what you accomplish in a set amount of time.
- It’s about how deeply you experience your time.

In the next post, we’ll explore how Tiny Experiments reframes procrastination—not as failure, but as a signal to pay attention. It is still part of ACT.

Until then, I hope you find a little Kairos in your day today, and so do I.
