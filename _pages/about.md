Hi, I'm a freelance software engineer and data scientist based in the Netherlands. After more than a decade solving complex engineering problems in large organizations, I decided to break away from the system and focus on the kind of work that truly energizes me.

I specialize in:
- **Machine learning systems** that go beyond notebooks‚Äîrobust, scalable, and in production
- **Real-time and session-based recommendations** that drive value and personalization
- **Taming complexity** in data, infrastructure, and product decision-making

## üß≠ Why I Work This Way

I believe good engineering is about **clarity and care**‚Äînot just cleverness.

Over the years, I‚Äôve seen how powerful it is when teams align technical decisions with user needs and long-term strategy. I now partner with companies who value that kind of deep, intentional thinking.

Whether it's helping your team set up the right architecture, shipping a new recommendation engine, or coaching through a messy refactor‚ÄîI bring experience, curiosity, and a hands-on mindset.

## üåç Working With Me

I work with teams in the Netherlands, Belgium, or remote-first setups. Flexible on structure: short-term, long-term, advisory, or implementation.

Let‚Äôs build something that matters.
