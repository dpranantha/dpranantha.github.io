I am a software/data engineer and a cat lover living in the Netherlands. I code mostly in JVM languages (Java/Kotlin/Scala) and Python.

I received my Ph.D. degree in January 2015 from TU Eindhoven and the University of Genoa as part of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Program (EMJD). I worked on
serious games, focusing on relations between flow and learning and recognizing flow via physiological signals.
The research output is available [here](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/experiments-on-flow-and-learning-in-games-creating-services-to-su).
- keywords: flow, learning, physiological signals, user state classification, support vector machine (SVM)
